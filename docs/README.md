Sprint summary: In our first sprint, our team completed the core "Must-have" features designed to transition Chizzling from manual to digital operations. In our ticketing system, we closed out US-01: Digital Transaction Processing and US-02: Receipt After Sale. These features allow our cashiers to process sales with automatic calculations and generate e-receipts for customers. We also implemented a secure login system for the owner, a sales dashboard for monitoring profitability, and a product management module to keep the digital menu up to date. During this process, we encountered several challenges, particularly regarding technical and resource constraints. Since we have no allocated budget, we relied entirely on free tools like Python and SQLite, which required us to be very intentional about database optimization to avoid lag. Additionally, our schedule constraints limited our full-team collaboration making communication efficiency vital. In the next sprint, we plan to improve our performance optimization and begin implementing "Should-have" features, such as restock suggestions and profitability reports, to give the owner better insights into the business.

PART V: Code Review & Reflection
One of the strongest aspects of the system is its proper separation of concerns using an MVC-like structure. The code clearly separates the presentation layer (UI widgets using Tkinter), the business logic (transaction processing), and the data access layer (database operations). The receipt generation is modularized in a separate file (receipt_module.py), while database setup and initialization are isolated in setup_database.py. This modular structure makes the code easier to maintain, test, debug, and extend in the future. Additionally, the overall codebase is well organized and follows a clean and readable structure

While the system functions correctly, input validation and error handling can still be improved. The current implementation has minimal validation. These enhancements would make the system more secure, reliable, and production-ready.

The lessons learned during implantations are; using proper table relationships and foreign keys made transaction tracking reliable and ensured data integrity. Good database planning simplifies future expansion and reporting. Separating the receipt module from the main POS system allowed independent testing and easier feature additions without breaking core functionality. Programming the login system was not difficult because Tkinter was already introduced in first year. Having prior knowledge of the framework helped speed up development
