Sprint summary: In our first sprint, our team completed the core "Must-have" features designed to transition Chizzling from manual to digital operations. In our ticketing system, we closed out US-01: Digital Transaction Processing and US-02: Receipt After Sale. These features allow our cashiers to process sales with automatic calculations and generate e-receipts for customers. We also implemented a secure login system for the owner, a sales dashboard for monitoring profitability, and a product management module to keep the digital menu up to date. During this process, we encountered several challenges, particularly regarding technical and resource constraints. Since we have no allocated budget, we relied entirely on free tools like Python and SQLite, which required us to be very intentional about database optimization to avoid lag. Additionally, our schedule constraints limited our full-team collaboration making communication efficiency vital. In the next sprint, we plan to improve our performance optimization and begin implementing "Should-have" features, such as restock suggestions and profitability reports, to give the owner better insights into the business.
