a. Separation of Concerns
- This ensures that sales processing, inventory management, and reporting are handled independently, making the system easier to maintain and update without affecting other components.

b. Modularity
- The system is divided into modules such as POS, Inventory, and Reports, allowing each part to be developed, tested, and improved separately.
