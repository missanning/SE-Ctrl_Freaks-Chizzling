1. Architectural Style
The Model–View–Controller (MVC) architectural style was chosen because it separates the system into organized parts, making the system easier to develop and manage. Each component has a specific role, which helps reduce complexity and confusion during development.

4. Design Principles Applied (at least 2)
a. Separation of Concerns
- This ensures that sales processing, inventory management, and reporting are handled independently, making the system easier to maintain and update without affecting other components.

b. Modularity
- The system is divided into modules such as POS, Inventory, and Reports, allowing each part to be developed, tested, and improved separately.
